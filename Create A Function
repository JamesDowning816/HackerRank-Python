# An extra day is added to the calendar every four years as feb 29. It's called  a leap year
# In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years: 
# The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# 1. THe year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# 1a. The year is also evenly divisble by 400, THen it is a leap year. 
# Task: 
# Given a year, deteremine whehter it is a leap year. If it's a leap year, return the boolean true. Otherwise return false. 
# Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguements like is_leap function. 
# It's only neccessary to complete the is_leap function.
